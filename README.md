# On the Efficiency of Software Implementations of Lightweight Block Ciphers from the Perspective of Programming Languages


In this work, we have highlighted the impact of choice relating to implementation type, programming language, operating system and platform on the performance of block ciphers. We implemented the LED block cipher in 4 programming languages (Java, C#, C++ and Python) for 3 key settings (64, 80 and 128-bit). The results show that these choices can affect the efficiency of a cryptographic primitive by a factor as high as 400.
